# Text-To-Sound

What is "Text to Sound"?

I convert the data by converting the string to hexadecimal, converting to decimal, and finally converting to duodecimal. 
It is interesting to note that the duodecimal number can be programmed to with the 12th scale of the piano and entered on that scale, 
for example, assuming duodecimal '0' as scale 'C' and duodecimal '1' as scale 'C#'.
Simply put, this is the connection that words, sentences, etc. can be intuited as melodies. 
In other words, Friedrich Nietzsche cultivated a longing for the history of his own philosophy through pure music. 
My unwavering belief that my wish can be visualized as source code led to the main focus of making this. 
I hope that this trivial notion will become strong as a new philosophy that represents music with letters.

p.s.
However, a small number of reserved opinions can be concluded by dismissing this as an incomprehensible transformation and misrepresenting intuition, 
but I admit that I am not referring to opinion in such a production.
